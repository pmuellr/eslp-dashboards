# eslp Dashboards

Dashboards for Elasticsearch built with the 
[Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework), using ES|QL,
accessing clusters via [`eslp`](https://github.com/pmuellr/eslp) and using
[Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) for visualizations.

For more info on running an Observable Framework apps, see:
For more, see <https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started>.

The dashboards are hosted live at https://pmuellr.github.io/eslp-dashboards
, however you will have to have `eslp` set up to view any data.
