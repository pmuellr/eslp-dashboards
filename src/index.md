This site is built with the Observable Framework, and requires the use
of `eslp` - elasticsearch local proxy.  It allows you to run dashboards
hosted in a public space, which only access data directly from the
browser.  Luckily, since you're running `elsp`, you have access to 
Elasticsearch and Kibana APIs - CORS friendly and all that.  For
multiple clusters, on the same plane of glass or quickly switchable.
